As the computer science tradition demands, we must start with a **Hello World**.

Though I have to say this hello world took quite a long time to reach the
internet. I've been thinking about setting up this website for way over a year,
but there are always too many things to decide - what Static Site Generator
will I use? Where should I get a domain from? Which registrar would be better
now? What if I want to set up a mail server, is it good enough? Oh, and what
about the theme, which one to choose? Can I get one simple enough to not fetch
javascript or css from external sources?

This was taking so long that even my friends were saying "Please, just share
your screen and let's do it **now**!". Well, rejoice friends, now it's done!
