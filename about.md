title: About me
---

My name is Carlos Henrique, but everyone calls me Charles - except my mom, but
that's besides the point :-)

I'm a Free Software Advocate, Debian Developer, Computer Engineer and Software
Engineer currently working in the embedded systems field at Toradex.

I really really enjoy learning new things and how everything works, specially
in the computer world. And one of my hobbies is learn as much as possible about
computer history and the advent of Unix at Bell Labs.

## My story

As a kid and a teenager, I always thought I was going to be a Mechanical
Engineer working in the automotive field - actually developing and building
cool cars. And so I went to university to become an Mechatronics Engineer at
University of SÃ£o Paulo.

Well, the problem is Mechanical Engineer isn't as cool as I thought - doing
technical drawings, calculating the forces on a shaft, and analyzing the marks
left by a lathe is not on my top 10 coolest things to do.

Thankfully, one of the courses from the first semester was introduction to
programming and we had an awesome teacher, Kalinka. She taught us how to
program in C, how memory works - on an abstract level -, how pointers are cool
and obviously the forbiden keyword in C, goto. From that moment forward, I
realized computer science was the thing that kept me awake at night or watching
videos on weekends. After one year, I made the decision to ask for a transfer
to the Computer Engineer program and I've never looked back.
