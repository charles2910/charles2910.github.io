The other day a friend of mine said she spent quite some time trying to set up
a GPG key pair (yeah, I know, the standard is called PGP and GPG is only an
implementation, but nowadays the terms are used interchangeably and I'll do it
here because it's friday night and I really don't want to think every time if I
should use GPG or PGP :-). Well, a few years ago I had to go trhough the same
and hunt down any documentation, blog or wiki page on the internet to try to do
a decent job on the keys I'd use for my Debian contributions.
